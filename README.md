### Static variables 
*have a property of preserving their value even after they are out of their scope!* Hence, static variables preserve their previous value in their previous scope and are not initialized again in the new scope. 
##### Syntax: 

`static data_type var_name = var_value; `
#### Following are some interesting facts about static variables in C
1) A static int variable remains in memory while the program is running. A normal or auto variable is destroyed when a function call where the variable was declared is over. 
For example, we can use static int to count a number of times a function is called, but an auto variable canâ€™t be used for this purpose.
2) Static variables are allocated memory in data segment, not stack segment. 
3) Static variables (like global variables) are initialized as 0 if not initialized explicitly. For example in the below program, value of x is printed as 0, while value of y is something garbage.
``` c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    static int x;
    int y;
    printf("%d \n %d", x, y);
}
```
Output
``` c
0 
[some_garbage_value] 
```
4) In C, static variables can only be initialized using constant literals. 
5) Static variables should not be declared inside structure.
